#       Exercise 7: Sorting Product Inventory by Category ID

#   Description: An e-commerce company needs to sort its entire product 
# inventory for a bulk export. Each product has a category_id which is an 
# integer between 1 and 1000. The primary requirement is to sort millions of 
# products by this category_id in linear time (O(n)). Stability is also 
# required to maintain the original product order within each category.

#   Specifications & Theory:

# The sorting must achieve linear time complexity. This rules out any 
# comparison-based sort, which has a lower bound of Î©(n log n).
# The keys (category_id) are integers within a known, relatively small range.
# The sort must be stable.

#   Key Skills:

# Recognizing that the problem constraints (integer keys in a small range, 
# linear time requirement) point to a non-comparison sort.
# Implementing an appropriate linear-time sorting algorithm.

#   Software Engineering Principles:

# Efficiency: Choosing an algorithm that meets a strict linear time 
# requirement by leveraging data properties.
# Scalability: The solution should handle millions of items efficiently.


#   Artificial Data: A generator for a large list of product tuples 
# (product_sku, category_id).
