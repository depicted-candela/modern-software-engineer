        <h3 id="concept-big-o-notation">Concept: Big O Notation – The "Time Carpet" of Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Imagine a vast <span class="rhyme">Time Carpet</span> stretching out before you, its fibers representing the operations an algorithm performs. Big O notation (<code>O(n)</code>, <code>O(log n)</code>, <code>O(n log n)</code>, <code>O(n^2)</code>) is our way of describing how this carpet grows, how its <em>area</em> (time) or <em>thickness</em> (space) stretches as your input, <code>n</code>, expands. It's not about the exact thread count, but the fundamental <em>pattern</em> of its weave.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Property: "Dominant Thread" Focus</strong> – Big O is a <span class="rhyme">strategic over-specification</span> of complexity. It focuses on the boldest, thickest thread (<code>n^2</code> in <code>5n^2 + 20n + 100</code>) that dictates the carpet’s overall growth, letting the thinner, ancillary threads fade into the background.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Value/Advantage: <span class="rhyme">Clarity Immediate</span></strong> – This <span class="rhyme">simplicity made complex</span> allows for instant, head-to-head comparison of algorithms. Which algorithm is faster for a truly enormous dataset? Big O gives you the answer without needing to count every minuscule operation. It's why we say <code>O(100n^2 + 500n + 1000)</code> is simply <code>O(n^2)</code>—the squared term is the <span class="rhyme">growth engine</span>, driving the performance narrative.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantage: <span class="rhyme">Tiny Cuts</span> in Performance</strong> – While <code>O(n^2)</code> vs. <code>O(n log n)</code> is a <span class="rhyme">future unknowable</span> for small inputs, sometimes an <code>O(n^2)</code> algorithm with incredibly small "hidden constant" factors can actually <em>beat</em> an <code>O(n log n)</code> algorithm with large constants. This makes initial "back-of-the-envelope" estimates useful, but for production systems, <span class="rhyme">benchmarking is a conversation with the machine</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Utility Context: <span class="rhyme">Infinite Scale</span> on Demand</strong> – It's the <span class="rhyme">architectural primary</span> when designing systems for scalability, helping us choose algorithms that perform well as data volume reaches <span class="rhyme">infinite scale</span> on demand.</li>

        <h4>Example 1.1: Understanding Big O with Polynomials – Plotting Your Algorithm's Destiny</h4>
        <p>Imagine plotting your algorithm's <em>destiny</em> on a Time Carpet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>f1(n) = 5n^2 + 20n + 100</code> (A <span class="rhyme">quadratic ascent</span>)</li>
            <li><code>f2(n) = 0.1n^3 + 50n^2</code> (A <span class="rhyme">cubic surge</span>)</li>
            <li><code>f3(n) = 1000 * log(n) + 50</code> (A <span class="rhyme">logarithmic whisper</span>)</li>
        </ul>

# Artificial Data: A journey from tiny to vast inputs
n_values = range(1, 100) # Small to medium range, where constants *play*

# f1(10) = 800
# f2(10) = 5100 (f2 is currently higher than f1, due to its large constant factor for n^2)
# --- Plot 2: The "Asymptotic Revelation" (Log Scale for true understanding) ---

plt.show()
# Discussion: With the y-axis on a logarithmic scale, the curves' true shapes emerge.
# Even with a small coefficient, f2(n)'s cubic growth rapidly surpasses f1(n)'s quadratic growth.
# f1(100) = 52100
# f2(100) = 600000 (f2 now vastly surpasses f1, the cubic term has become the "growth engine")

<h3 id="21-bubble-sort">2.1 Bubble Sort – The <span class="rhyme">Persistent Pusher</span></h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Bubble Sort is the <span class="rhyme">persistent pusher</span> of sorting algorithms. It's like gently nudging adjacent elements in a crowded line. If one person is out of place, you swap them with their neighbor, and you keep doing this, repeatedly passing through the line, until everyone is finally in order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pattern: Adjacent Comparison and Swap</strong> – The fundamental <span class="rhyme">motion without movement</span> of Bubble Sort. Each pair is a mini-decision point.</li>
<li><strong>Property (In-place): <span class="rhyme">Space-Divine Efficiency</span></strong> – It's a <span class="rhyme">space-divine</span> sort, operating directly on the input array, requiring minimal extra room—just enough for a temporary swap. This is a <span class="rhyme">seamless integration</span> of data and processing.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Value/Advantage: <span class="rhyme">Unprecedented Accuracy</span></strong> – <code>O(1)</code> space complexity is its <span class="rhyme">unprecedented accuracy</span> for memory-constrained environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Disadvantage: <span class="rhyme">Terminal Obsolete</span> Time</strong> – For large datasets, its <code>O(n^2)</code> <span class="rhyme">quadratic ascent</span> makes it <span class="rhyme">terminal obsolete</span>. It’s like trying to sort a library by only comparing two adjacent books at a time.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Its simplicity is a <span class="rhyme">simplicity bridge</span> to understanding more complex sorts. It’s often used as a baseline for <span class="rhyme">performance optimal</span> comparisons.</li>
<li><strong>Utility Context:</strong> Best for extremely small lists or teaching. It's where <span class="rhyme">complexity surrenders</span> to intuitive understanding.</li>

<h4>Code Example 2.1.1: Bubble Sort – Watching the Nudges</h4>

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Concept: Bubble Sort - repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements.
    Pattern: Adjacent comparison and swap.
    Property: In-place sorting.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place, so we don't need to check them.
        swapped = False # Optimization: if no swaps in a pass, list is sorted (Best case: O(n))
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped: # Best-case optimization: The "early exit" shortcut.
            break
    return arr
# Artificial Data: See how different starting points affect the "nudges"
data_worst_case = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] # A completely backwards line
data_best_case = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # An already perfect line
data_average_case = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90] # A typically jumbled queue
print(f"Bubble Sort Worst Case: {bubble_sort(list(data_worst_case))}")
print(f"Bubble Sort Best Case: {bubble_sort(list(data_best_case))}")
print(f"Bubble Sort Average Case: {bubble_sort(list(data_average_case))}")
# Time Complexity:
# Worst-case (reverse sorted): O(n^2) - a "quadratic ascent" of comparisons and swaps.
# Best-case (already sorted): O(n) - a "linear stroll" to confirm order.
# Average-case: O(n^2) - still a "quadratic ascent."
# Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place) - a "space-divine" sort.
```
<p><small><strong>Software Engineering Principles</strong>: <strong>Efficiency</strong>: Code includes an optimization to achieve <code>O(n)</code> in the best case, demonstrating awareness of common improvements. <strong>Clarity</strong>: Its simplicity makes it a good <span class="rhyme">starting point</span> for understanding more complex sorts.</small></p>
<h3 id="22-merge-sort">2.2 Merge Sort – The <span class="rhyme">Assembly Line Harmonizer</span></h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Merge Sort is the <span class="rhyme">assembly line harmonizer</span> of sorting algorithms. It breaks down the problem into smaller, independent chunks, sorts them, and then meticulously reassembles them. Think of it as a <span class="rhyme">digital assembly-line</span>, where data flows through a <span class="rhyme">process alchemical</span>, transforming chaos into order.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pattern: Divide-and-Conquer</strong> – This is its <span class="rhyme">growth engine</span>. The list is recursively split until each piece is trivially sorted, then the pieces are merged. This <span class="rhyme">seamless integration</span> ensures all elements are processed.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Divide</strong>: The array undergoes a <span class="rhyme">recursive split</span>, becoming two halves.</li>
            <li><strong>Conquer</strong>: Each half undergoes <span class="rhyme">synthetic evolution</span>, sorting itself independently.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine</strong>: The two sorted halves are melded in a <span class="rhyme">symbiotic dance</span>, creating a single, larger sorted list.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Property (Stable): <span class="rhyme">Order Emerges</span></strong> – Merge Sort is a <span class="rhyme">state-divine</span> stable sort. If two elements have the same value, their original relative order is preserved after sorting.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Value/Advantage:</strong> Essential when data carries additional context (satellite data) that must remain associated with its original position if keys are equal. This makes its workflow <span class="rhyme">frictionless absolute</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantage: Space <span class="rhyme">Gravity Song</span></strong> – It requires <code>O(n)</code> auxiliary space for merging, making it a <span class="rhyme">space-hungry</span> sort. This is the <span class="rhyme">gravity song</span> of its memory footprint.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Its <code>O(n log n)</code> performance is a <span class="rhyme">time conductor</span>, consistently efficient in all scenarios. It's often compared to Quick Sort, which is generally faster due to lower constant factors but sacrifices stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Utility Context:</strong> Critical for large datasets, especially when stability is a requirement, such as in external sorting or data processing pipelines. It's where <span class="rhyme">order emerges</span> from a sea of data.</li>

<h3 id="23-heap-sort">2.3 Heap Sort – The <span class="rhyme">Hierarchical Constructor</span></h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Heap Sort is the <span class="rhyme">hierarchical constructor</span> of sorting algorithms. It builds a specialized <span class="rhyme">data mountain</span> (a max-heap) where the highest peak is always the largest element, then systematically dismantles it to create a sorted array. It's a <span class="rhyme">top-down builder</span> that prioritizes the largest element at each step.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Concept (Max-Heap): The <span class="rhyme">Data Mountain</span></strong> – A complete binary tree with the <span class="rhyme">parental dominance</span> property: <code>value(parent) >= value(children)</code>. The largest element is always at the root.</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern (Heapify): <span class="rhyme">Sift-down Cascade</span></strong> – This <span class="rhyme">sift-down cascade</span> maintains the heap property. If a node falls below its children in rank, it "sifts down," swapping with the larger child until its rightful place is found. This is a <span class="rhyme">recursive motion</span> ensuring balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern (Build Max-Heap): <span class="rhyme">Structural Genesis</span></strong> – This <span class="rhyme">structural genesis</span> transforms any random array into a max-heap. It's like carefully arranging a <span class="rhyme">digital landscape</span> by calling <code>heapify</code> on all non-leaf nodes, working upwards from the base.</li>
    <li><strong>Property (In-place): <span class="rhyme">Space-Divine Efficiency</span></strong> – Like Bubble Sort and Quick Sort, Heap Sort is <span class="rhyme">space-divine</span>, operating directly on the input array with <code>O(1)</code> auxiliary space.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Value/Advantage:</strong> Ideal for memory-constrained environments, offering a <span class="rhyme">performance optimal</span> solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Not a stable sort.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> It's another <code>O(n log n)</code> <span class="rhyme">time conductor</span>, making it asymptotically efficient in all cases (worst, average, best). Its strength lies in its guaranteed performance and minimal memory footprint.</li>
    <li><strong>Utility Context:</strong> Operating systems for priority queues, embedded systems with limited memory, or scenarios where guaranteed performance is more critical than stability.</li>

<h3 id="24-quicksort">2.4 Quicksort – The <span class="rhyme">Dynamic Partitioner</span></h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Quicksort is the <span class="rhyme">dynamic partitioner</span>, a high-performance <span class="rhyme">divide-and-conquer</span> sorting algorithm. It's like organizing a large group of people by having one person step forward (the pivot), and then everyone else quickly arranges themselves into two groups: those shorter than the pivot, and those taller. This process is then repeated in each smaller group.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pattern (Partitioning): <span class="rhyme">The Great Divide</span></strong> – This <span class="rhyme">great divide</span> splits the array into two sub-arrays based on a chosen pivot. Elements smaller than the pivot go to one side, larger to the other.</li>
    <li><strong>Concept (Randomized Pivot): <span class="rhyme">The Dice Roll Strategy</span></strong> – Instead of a fixed pivot, Quicksort often employs a <span class="rhyme">randomized pivot</span> strategy, akin to <span class="rhyme">the dice roll strategy</span>. This <code>O(1)</code> average selection helps avoid worst-case scenarios by making it highly probable to get a relatively balanced partition.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Value/Advantage:</strong> Makes the <code>O(n^2)</code> <span class="rhyme">worst-case path</span> extremely rare in practice, leading to <span class="rhyme">average-case optimal</span> performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Adds a minor overhead of random number generation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Property (In-place): <span class="rhyme">Space-Divine Efficiency</span></strong> – Like Heap Sort, Quicksort is <span class="rhyme">space-divine</span>, requiring minimal auxiliary space (average <code>O(log n)</code> for the recursion stack).
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Value/Advantage:</strong> Excellent for memory-constrained systems, particularly due to its <span class="rhyme">good cache performance</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Not stable.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Its average <code>O(n log n)</code> makes it one of the fastest general-purpose sorts in practice. It's a <span class="rhyme">performance driver</span> in many standard library implementations.</li>
    <li><strong>Utility Context:</strong> General-purpose sorting where average-case speed is prioritized and stability is not required. It's where <span class="rhyme">speed demons</span> reside.</li>

# This benchmark is our "performance observatory," revealing the true "Time Carpet" of each algorithm.
# - Bubble Sort (Theoretical: O(N^2) worst/avg, O(N) best): Empirically, for N=1000, its time will show a "quadratic ascent" dramatically outpacing others. Its "linear stroll" on sorted data might be surprisingly quick, but that's a "simplicity bridge" to false hope for large inputs.
# - Merge Sort (Theoretical: O(N log N) all cases): Shows "consistent precision" across all data types, reflecting its stable O(N log N) performance. Its "space gravity song" (O(N) space) is its primary trade-off.
# - Heap Sort (Theoretical: O(N log N) all cases): Similar to Merge Sort, but may have slightly different constant factors, showing "predictable robustness." It's "space-divine," making it memory-efficient.
# - Quick Sort (Theoretical: O(N log N) avg, O(N^2) worst): Will likely be the "speed demon" on random data due to cache efficiency (smaller constant factors). For sorted/reverse data, randomized partitioning should mitigate the O(N^2) "worst-case path," demonstrating its "dice roll strategy" working effectively, but might still be slightly slower than Merge/Heap due to inherent overhead for these particular 'worst-cases'.
# "Constant Factors" vs. "Asymptotic Revelation": For N=100, we might see "tiny cuts" in performance where constants cause minor deviations from Big O. However, for N=10000+, the "asymptotic revelation" is clear: O(N^2) algorithms become "terminal obsolete."

# Discussion for Hardcore Problem Solution: "The Data Flow Harmonizer"
# This "Data Stream Optimizer" is a "creativity engine," demonstrating how foundational algorithms and data structures combine to solve complex, real-world problems. It's a "data flow harmonizer" for high-frequency streams.
# - Efficiency & Scalability: The primary bottleneck, `_update_sorted_list`, is `O(M log M)`. While `set` and `deque` offer `O(1)` average operations for uniqueness and recency, the requirement to *keep* the active `M` unique elements sorted for `rank` forces this sorting overhead. For `M` small enough (e.g., M < 1000), `M log M` is acceptable for a "performance optimal" system. If `M` were extremely large, a more advanced data structure like a balanced Binary Search Tree or a Fenwick tree with an underlying sorted list (for O(log M) updates and rank queries) would provide "infinite scale" for updates.
# - Modifiability & Testability: The class structure is "dev-friendly by design," allowing internal data structures to be swapped (e.g., replacing `list.sort()` with a more efficient, `O(log M)` sorted structure if needed) without altering the external API. Each method is a testable unit.
# - Reliability: Robust handling of edge cases (empty lists, duplicates, boundary `M` values) ensures consistent and correct behavior, making it a "robust security" measure for data integrity.
# This problem is a "semantic catalyst," forcing a deep understanding of each component's properties and how they interact in a "symbiotic dance" to meet system requirements, truly making "clarity immediate" in a complex data stream.

<p><small><strong>Software Engineering Principles</strong>: <strong>Efficiency</strong>: The solution showcases pragmatic efficiency, making calculated trade-offs (e.g., <code>O(M log M)</code> sort for <code>O(log M)</code> search). <strong>Scalability</strong>: The <code>DataStreamOptimizer</code> scales effectively for continuous input streams, with performance bounds tied to <code>M</code>, not total stream size. <strong>Modifiability</strong>: The class design allows for future "plug-and-play" of more advanced sorting or balanced tree structures for <code>sorted_unique_list</code> if <code>M</code> scales beyond current efficiency. <strong>Testability</strong>: The structured data and clear return values make the <code>DataStreamOptimizer</code>'s behavior precisely testable across various scenarios. <strong>Reliability</strong>: Robust handling of edge cases (empty lists, duplicates, boundary <code>M</code> values) ensures consistent and correct behavior.</small></p>
